## Tasks Overview

### L02-T1: Basic Data Types, Input, Calculation, Output
**Goal:** Gather user input (name, integer, float), raise the float to the power of the integer, and display the result.

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter your name: Robin  
Enter an integer: 8  
Enter a float: 3.46  
Decimal 3.46 to power 8 is 20540.39  
Thank you for using the program, Robin!
```

### L02-T3: Cuts and Length of Strings
**Goal:** Perform and display various string slicing operations.

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter a long word: trichotillomania  
The first five letters are: trich  
The last five letters are: mania  
Letters 2, 3, 4 and 5 are: rich  
Every second letter of the word: rcoilmna  
The word backwards 'ainamollitohcirt'  
Enter start index: 3  
Enter end index: 11  
Enter step: 2  
With these values 'trichotillomania' produces this: coil  
Your word is 16 characters long
