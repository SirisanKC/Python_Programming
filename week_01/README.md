# Python Basics - Week 1 Tasks

This repository contains simple Python exercises designed to introduce programming concepts such as printing, variables, user input, and basic arithmetic operations.

## Getting Started

These exercises are intended to be run using the **IDLE editor** that comes with Python. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).

## Tasks Overview

### L01-T1: The First Python Program
**Goal:** Print a simple message to the screen.

- **Output:**  
  ```
  Hello Finland! Here we go!
  ```

### L01-T2: Setting and Printing the Variable Value
**Goal:** Practice using variables and `print()` with formatted output.

- Declare two integers: 50 and 150.
- Print them on the same line, separated by a space.
- Add text between the values in another line.
- Print a custom message.

**Sample Output:**
```
50 150  
50 This text comes between variables 150  
I am writing this code!
```

### L01-T3: Calculation Operations and Printing
**Goal:** Get numeric input from the user and display calculations.

- Ask for two product prices.
- Print their values and their sum.

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter the price of product 1: 7  
Enter the price of product 2: 8  
Product 1 costs 7 e and product 2 costs 8 e.  
The sum of the product prices is 15 euros.
```

### L01-T4: Querying and Printing Text
**Goal:** Get text input from the user and respond with a message.

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter your name: Matti  
Welcome coder Matti
```

### L01-T5: More Calculation
**Goal:** Perform a variety of arithmetic operations between two numbers.

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, exponentiation, and modulus.

**Sample Output:**
```
Give the first integer: 26  
Give the second integer: 4  
26 + 4 = 30  
26 - 4 = 22  
26 * 4 = 104  
26 / 4 = 6.5  
26 // 4 = 6  
26 ** 4 = 456976  
26 % 4 = 2
```

## How to Run

1. Open IDLE.
2. Create a new file for each task (e.g., `L01_T1.py`, `L01_T2.py`, etc.).
3. Paste the code and run using F5 or "Run -> Run Module".
